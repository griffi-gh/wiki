The Principia Wiki is open for anyone with a principia-web account to contribute. If you find something on a page that should be added or changed, then just press the 'Edit' link and make an edit!

As this is a wiki, obviously anyone can fix anything afterwards, including any speeling [sic] mistakes and oddities. Don't feel discouraged!

If you would like to discuss any changes, feel free to drop by the `#wiki` channel on Discord or post in the [Wiki thread](/forum/thread?id=20) on the forums.

## Guidelines
There are some loosely defined guidelines for the wiki, which you should read and take into consideration.

* (Obviously) Has to be Principia related.
  * If Apparatus and Tesla Plushies content should be in this Wiki or in a new, separate one has not been decided yet. Content which applies to two or more games including Principia is of course allowed here.
* Page titles should be Title Cased Whenever Possible.
  * "Small" words like prepositions should not be capitalised. We do not follow any particular handbook in terms of what constitutes as one, but use your best judgement.
  * Object names with different casing is an exception.
