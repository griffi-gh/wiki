Starting with the open source version of Principia, the Android version now stores its user data in its scoped app storage. This is caused by a restriction of recent Android API levels and Google Play policies and it is unfortunately impossible to store it in the old more accessible /sdcard/Principia/ location.

This storage area can tend to be fragile and will be deleted when you uninstall the Principia app, so it is recommended to frequently back up this location to keep your locally saved levels safe.
