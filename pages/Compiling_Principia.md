For information on compiling Principia from source, [see the "Building and running" section in the README](https://github.com/Bithack/principia#building-and-running).

Below are also some miscellaneous notes for running Principia on particular platforms.

## Notes

### Raspberry Pi
Principia works fine on a Raspberry Pi (tested by ROllerozxa on a Pi 4B running Arch Linux ARM), just follow the regular compilation steps for the Linux distro branch of your choosing.

### Chrome OS
If your Chromebook is relatively recent, it supports running Linux inside of a container. Principia should run fine inside of this container, obtain it like you would with any other Linux system. (tested by ROllerozxa on an ASUS C213N Chromebook with an Arch Linux container)
