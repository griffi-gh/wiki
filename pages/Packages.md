Packages are a mostly unused feature in Principia, outside of the built-in puzzle package.

Packages are, as can probably be figured out, a series of levels packaged together. They can be selectable from a level selector, with a specific amount of levels being unlocked at a particular time (see the puzzle package). Alternatively the first level can act as an in-game level selector, using the [[Pkg Warp]] and [[Pkg Status]] objects to manage level completion and warping (akin to a SM64-like level selector world).

Initially during Principia's development it was intended for players to create their own packages and upload them to the community site using the game's Package Manager dialog ^(PC only)^. However this was seemingly scrapped around the game's release and users' package listings were quietly commented out from the community site.
