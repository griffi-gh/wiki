Outputs 1 when both of its inputs are 1.

The AND gate is a binary device. If both **`IN0`** and **`IN1`** is 1, output 1. Otherwise output 0. Since this is a binary device, the input value is rounded so any value above 0.5 is equal to 1.

## Socket information:
- **`IN0`**: Value A
- **`IN1`**: Value B
- **`OUT0`**: A AND B
