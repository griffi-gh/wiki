## What is principia-web?
Back in late 2020, ROllerozxa launched a new unofficial community site called principia-web, making it possible to easily share your levels again. It's later expanded into including a forum and this wiki. With the open sourcing principia-web is considered to be the primary community site, with the old community site being provided as an archive playable for those with a recent version of open source Principia.

## So Principia is open source now?
Yes, sdac came back and released the source code in August 2022. It is available on GitHub, and is continuing development as an open source project. The next version is going to be 1.5.2, you can find beta builds on the [download page](/download).

### When are beta builds for Android coming?
Soon, when they are more stable.

## Where are my old levels?
They are available in the [Community Site Archive](https://archive.principia-web.se). Keep in mind in order to play levels you need a recent build of open source Principia.

### Why doesn't the archive work on Android?
Probably because you are using an outdated build.

## Who is ROllerozxa?
